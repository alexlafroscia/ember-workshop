# Ember Workshop

App for demonstating how an Ember.js application is structured, providing a playground for making changes on your own.  Great for learning about the framework and usage during short beginner-oriented workshops.

## Development Environment

### [Local Dev][local-setup]

> Recommended for people already comfortable with tools like Node and NPM

**Pros:**

- Better performance
- LiveReload when files change

**Cons:**

- Need Node and NPM installed already, which can be tricky to get right

Instructions for getting started with local development can be found [here][local-setup].

### [Nitrous.io][nitrous-setup]

> Cloud environment for working on projects on a server.  Recommended for those new to Web Development that may not have any of their environment set up yet but want to get started with relatively little setup.

**Pros:**

- Don't worry about installing anything locally
- Work from anywhere, with your code stored safely in [The Cloud](https://xkcd.com/908/)

**Cons:**

- Much slower than local development due to limited processing power and the nature of working in a cloud IDE

Instructions for getting started with Nitrous.io can be found [here][nitrous-setup].
